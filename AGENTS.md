# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
`azure-functions-openapi` provides OpenAPI generation and validation support for Python Azure Functions.

## Read First
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/agent-playbook.md`

## Working Rules

### Test Coverage
- Maintain test coverage at **95% or above** for committed changes and PRs.
- Run `hatch run pytest --cov --cov-report=term-missing -q` to verify before submitting changes.
- Any PR that drops coverage below 95% must include additional tests to compensate.
- Preserve the package's Python compatibility and public CLI behavior unless the change explicitly updates the contract.
- Keep documentation examples, generated schema expectations, and tests synchronized.
- Prefer focused changes inside the existing extension points.

### Documentation & Translations
- When a change touches `README.md` or any English documentation, update the translated READMEs (`README.ko.md`, `README.ja.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`) **in the same PR** so translations never drift from the English source.
- This applies to any code change that alters documented behavior, CLI output, or the ecosystem/package table — not just direct edits to prose.
- If a full translation cannot land in the same PR, add a short "translation pending" note to the affected translated file and open a tracking issue before merging.

## PR Workflow

**Always issue-first.** Before opening any PR:

1. Run `gh issue list` to check whether a tracking issue already exists for the change.
2. If no issue exists, create one following the Issue Conventions below before writing any code.
3. Open the PR only after the issue exists. The PR body **must** include `Closes #N` for every
   issue it resolves — never open a PR that cannot be traced back to an issue.

**Non-negotiable:** a PR without a linked issue will be rejected at review.

## Issue Conventions

Follow these conventions when opening issues so the backlog stays consistent with sibling DX Toolkit repositories.

### Title

- Use Conventional Commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `build:`, `perf:`.
- Add a scope qualifier when it narrows the area: `feat(cli):`, `docs(spec):`, `refactor(bridge):`.
- Keep the title imperative, under ~80 characters, no trailing period.
- Do **not** put `[P0]` / `[P1]` / `[P2]` (or any priority marker) in the title — priority is tracked with a `priority:p0` / `priority:p1` / `priority:p2` label.

### Body

Use the following sections, in order, omitting any that do not apply:

```
## Context
What problem this issue addresses and why now. Note the target release (e.g. vX.Y.Z) here if known.

## Acceptance Checklist
- [ ] Concrete, verifiable items.

## Out of scope
- Items intentionally excluded, with links to the issues that track them.

## References
- PRs, ADRs, sibling issues, external docs.
```

### Labels

- Apply at least one of `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `chore`.
- Apply exactly one `priority:p0` / `priority:p1` / `priority:p2` label to record priority (replaces the old `## Priority` body line).
- Add `area:*` labels when they exist in the repository.
- Use `blocker` only when the issue blocks a release.

### Umbrella issues

When splitting a large piece of work into focused issues, keep the umbrella open as a tracker that links each child issue with a checkbox; close it once every child is closed or explicitly deferred.

## Validation
- `make test`
- `make lint`
- `make typecheck`
- `make build`

## Release Process
- Version is managed via `hatch` (dynamic from `src/azure_functions_openapi/__init__.py`).
- **Do NOT manually edit version strings.** Use the Makefile targets below. The public-API test reads `__version__` against `importlib.metadata.version(...)`, so no test changes are needed when bumping.

### Commands
- `make release-patch` — bump patch version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make release-minor` — bump minor version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make release-major` — bump major version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make release VERSION=x.y.z` — set explicit version, update changelog, tag, and push
- `make tag-release VERSION=x.y.z` — create and push an annotated tag (used internally by release targets)

### Flow
1. `make release-patch` (or `-minor` / `-major`) on `main`
2. This runs: `hatch version` → `git commit` → `make changelog` → `git commit` → `git tag` → `git push`
3. Tag push triggers **Publish to PyPI** GitHub Actions workflow automatically.
4. Update `docs/changelog.md` separately if needed (different format from `CHANGELOG.md`).
5. **Verify the release against the dogfood cookbook.** Once **Publish to PyPI** succeeds, confirm the downstream consumer still passes on the freshly published version:
   - In [`azure-functions-cookbook-python`](https://github.com/yeongseon/azure-functions-cookbook-python), upgrade to the new release (`hatch run pip install -U "azure-functions-openapi>=X.Y,<1"`) and run `make test`.
   - Treat any new `RuntimeWarning`/`DeprecationWarning` surfaced by this library during the cookbook run as a release-blocking signal — decorator-order and API-drift problems are reported as warnings, so a clean run (zero warnings from this package) is part of the release gate.
   - If the cookbook pins a lower bound (`azure-functions-openapi>=X.Y,<1`), bump it to the new minor in the same verification PR so examples are tested against the version they advertise.
   - A release is **not** considered done until the cookbook passes on the published version.

## Branch Hygiene

- Merged PR branches are deleted automatically ("Automatically delete head branches" is enabled on this repository); keep that setting on.
- When merging from the CLI, always pass `--delete-branch` (e.g. `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`) so the head branch is removed.
- Never delete `main` or `gh-pages`, and never delete a branch that still has an open PR.
- Run `git fetch -p` periodically to prune stale local tracking refs.
